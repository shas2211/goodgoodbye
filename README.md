# goodgoodbye
Hello ppl,
heres the entire code just download the code snippet , paste in the vs code or whatever u use and install the required packages .
Annnd run the code it may take a bit time to load but dont worry it works fine as wine.
Btw this code just copies your actions and displays on the left of the screen with delay . So that it actually looks like u have gf (which u dont) and she is dancing along with u.
Song used in the reel is good goodbye .
well I hope this helps and u get a gf before feb 14 .
